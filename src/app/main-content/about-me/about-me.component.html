                I am a musician and frontend developer based in Germany. For over ten years, I have been working as a
                professional vocalist and upright bass player.
                <br>
                Everytime i make music, i start with a simple melody or a couple of notes and then i build around it.
                <br>
                <br>
                The same melody and notes i find in my work as a frontend developer. It starts with a simple line of
                code but the same line can take you to countless ideas and solutions.
                <br>
                Take a look around and explore some of my projects i composed and developed so far.

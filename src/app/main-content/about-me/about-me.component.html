                <strong>Hi, I'm Preston!</strong><br>
                I am a passionate frontend developer and musician based in Germany. With over ten years of experience as a
                professional vocalist and upright bass player, I bring a unique perspective to my work in frontend
                development.
                <br>
                <br>
                In both music and development, I start with a simple idea, a melody, a few notes, or a line of code and
                build around it. This approach allows me to create innovative and dynamic user interfaces that are not
                only functional but also visually appealing and user friendly.
                <br>
                <br>
                Throughout my time as a frontend developer, I have honed my skills in transforming complex problems
                into elegant solutions. My work emphasizes intuitive design and seamless user experiences, ensuring that
                each project meets the highest standards of quality and aesthetics.
                <br>
                <br>
                I invite you to explore my portfolio and review a selection of the projects I have created and
                developed.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you are interested in collaborating or simply want to say hello, please feel free to contact me.
